## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Verification Code Not Working
**Solution:** The verification code is now properly stored in the database and displayed on the verification page. Make sure to use the exact code shown on the screen.

### Issue: Can't Login After Registration
**Solution:** Make sure you've verified your email first. If you skipped verification, you can:
1. Try to login - it will redirect you to the verification page
2. Use the code displayed on the verification page
3. After verification, login again

### Issue: Forgot Password
**Solution:** Use the "Forgot your password?" link on the login page. For demo purposes, you can also use the demo reset form.

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Demo Mode:** The verification codes are displayed on screen instead of being sent via email. In a production environment, you would integrate an email service.

2. **Security:** Passwords are securely hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` function.

3. **Session Management:** User sessions are properly managed and secured.

4. **Database:** All data is stored in a MariaDB database with proper relationships.

## 🎨 Customization

You can customize the following:
- **Colors:** Edit `css/style.css`
- **Logo:** Add your logo to the sidebar
- **Features:** Modify the feature cards on the homepage
- **Email Templates:** Update the email verification class
