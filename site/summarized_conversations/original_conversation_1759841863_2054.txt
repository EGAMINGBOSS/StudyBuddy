Based on the screenshot you provided, we need to implement a complete login and signup system\n\nLet's create a complete working solution. I'll start by creating the necessary directory structure and files:\n\n<function_calls>\n<execute-command>\nmkdir -p website/StudentPlatform/config\nmkdir -p website/StudentPlatform/css\nmkdir -p website/StudentPlatform/js\nmkdir -p website/StudentPlatform/includes\n</execute-command>\n</function_calls>"}
