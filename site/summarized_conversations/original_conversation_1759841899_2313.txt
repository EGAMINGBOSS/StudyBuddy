Here\'s what I\'ve done:\n\n## What\'s Fixed:\n1. Created a complete authentication system with:\n   - Login functionality\n   - Registration with email verification\n   - Password reset capability\n   - User profile management\n\n2. Set up the database:\n   - Created the necessary tables for users, preferences, and verification codes\n   - Added proper relationships between tables\n   - Set up secure password hashing\n\n3. Created a modern, responsive UI:\n   - Implemented the login/signup interface as shown in your screenshot\n   - Added form validation (both client-side and server-side)\n   - Created a user-friendly verification process\n\n## How to Use:\n1. The website is now running at: https://9000-fd03a152-35f4-464b-888b-b502ded0f888.proxy.daytona.works\n2. You can access:\n   - The main page: `/index.html` or `/index.php`\n   - Login page: `/login.php`\n   - Registration page: `/register.php`\n   - Password reset: `/reset-password.php`\n\n3. For testing:\n   - You can register a new account\n   - For email verification, use the demo code shown on the verification page\n   - After verification, you can log in with your credentials\n\n## Technical Details:\n- PHP 8.2 with MariaDB database\n- Bootstrap 4 for responsive design\n- jQuery for AJAX form submissions\n- Secure password hashing with PHP\'s password_hash()\n\nI\'ve attached a ZIP file containing the complete solution. You can download and deploy it to your own server if needed.\n\nIs there anything specific about the authentication system you\'d like me to explain further?\n</ask>\n</function_calls>'}
